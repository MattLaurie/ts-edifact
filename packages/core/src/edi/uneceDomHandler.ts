 * Customization of the `DomHandler` class to allow for extending the behavior
 * performed on processing text and "open tags by the dom handler.
 *
 * This implementation is necessary due to a version update of htmlparser2
 * and/or domhandler which now manages elements passed to the `opentag` method
 * by putting such on an `openTag` stack and removing these on processing
 * `onclosetag` calls. By replacing the function calls as previously done
 * DomHandler isn't able to manage this tag stack properly and thus invalid
 * operations are attempted on `undefined` references.
 *
 * This implementation overrides `ontext` and `onopentag` methods of DomHandler
 * and defines two replacement functions (`onText` and`onOpenTag`), which need
 * to be implemented by the user class. These replacement functions are invoked
 * after the parent methods got called.
